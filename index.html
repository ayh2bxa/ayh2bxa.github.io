    <h1>Real-time AI acoustic echo cancellation (AEC)</h1>
    <p class="video-description">A C++ implementation of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11388" target="_blank">NKF-AEC</a> model. Official source code is in Python.

    <h1>Virtual Eurhythmics tutor (ongoing)</h1>
    <p class="video-description">Rhythm recognition is a crucial part of <a href="https://info.utheory.com/dal-who-your-what-an-introduction-to-dalcroze-eurhythmics-def21f25dba6/" target="_blank">Dalcroze Eurhythmics</a>, a teaching method that develops musicianship through bodily movement. This small program generates a sequence from random combinations of notes with different durations. 
                           It is intended to aid Eurhythmics students in connecting groove with movements, or users can simply use it to practise rhythm dictation. 
                           In the future, more complex meters and interactive experiences will be included. GUI developed under the JUCE framework, algorithms and logic designed by myself. Sounds come from FL Studio's built-in samples. See video for more explanation.

    <h1>Filter-dependent point cloud audio visualisation</h1>
    <p class="video-description">This audio visualisation work features a filter that controls granularity of point cloud. You can draw the filter shape arbitrarily with your mouse. The more low-frequency content the filter preserves, the larger an individual point. The music used is an excerpt from my single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVlBo7j8zts" target="_blank">"20 Dreams"</a>, and the photo used for the visualisation is taken by myself.</p>

    <h1>Transformer voice effect</h1>
    <p class="video-description">Inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_l7P5Aq7gI" target="_blank">this tutorial</a>, I wrote a real-time C++ program to emulate the deep robotic voices of the Transformers. The samples used are chosen from FL Studio's built-in sample packs. The GUI is developed under the JUCE framework, the FFT function is developed by <a href="https://github.com/Signalsmith-Audio/fft/blob/main/signalsmith-fft.h" target="_blank">Signalsmith</a>, but all the remaining DSP algorithms and real-time optimisations are written by myself from scratch.</p>
